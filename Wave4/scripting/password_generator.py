#Write a function called generate_password that selects three random words from the list of words word_list and concatenates them into a single string. Your function should not accept any arguments and should reference the global variable word_list to build the password.

# Use an import statement at the top
import random

word_file = "words.txt"
word_list = []

#fill up the word_list
with open(word_file,'r') as words:
	for line in words:
		# remove white space and make everything lowercase
		word = line.strip().lower()
		# don't include words that are too long or too short
		if 3 < len(word) < 8:
			word_list.append(word)

# print(word_list)

# Add your function generate_password here
# It should return a string consisting of three random words 
# concatenated together without spaces

def generate_password():
  word1 = random.choice(word_list)
  word2 = random.choice(word_list)
  word3 = random.choice(word_list)
  password = word1 + word2 + word3
  return password

# test your function
print(generate_password())
