#Factorials with While Loops
#Find the factorial of a number using a while loop.

#A factorial of a whole number is that number multiplied by every whole number between itself and 1. For example, 6 factorial (written "6!") equals 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720. So 6! = 720.

#We can write a while loop to take any given number and figure out what its factorial is.

#Example: If number is 6, your code should compute and print the product, 720.


# number to find the factorial of
number = 6   

# start with our product equal to one
product = 1

# track the current number being multiplied
current = 1

# write your while loop here
while current <= number:
    # multiply the product so far by the current number
    	
    
    # increment current with each iteration until it reaches number
    product = product * current
    current = current + 1
 

# print the factorial of number
print(product)
