#Break the String
#Write a loop with a break statement to create a string, news_ticker, that is exactly 140 characters long. You should create the news ticker by adding headlines from the headlines list, inserting a space in between each headline. If necessary, truncate the last headline in the middle so that news_ticker is exactly 140 characters long.

#Remember that break works in both for and while loops. Use whichever loop seems most appropriate. Consider adding print statements to your code to help you resolve bugs.

# HINT: modify the headlines list to verify your loop works with different inputs
headlines = [
    "Local Bear Eaten by Man", "Legislature Announces New Laws",
    "Peasant Discovers Violence Inherent in System",
    "Cat Rescues Fireman Stuck in Tree", "Brave Knight Runs Away",
    "Papperbok Review: Totally Triffic"
]

news_ticker = ""
# write your loop here

for i in headlines:
    news_ticker += i + " "
    if len(news_ticker) > 140:
        news_ticker = news_ticker[:140]
        break

print(news_ticker)
