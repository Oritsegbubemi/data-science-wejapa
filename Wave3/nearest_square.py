#Nearest Square
#Write a while loop that finds the largest square number less than an integerlimit and stores it in a variable nearest_square. A square number is the product of an integer multiplied by itself, for example 36 is a square number because it equals 6*6.

#For example, if limit is 40, your code should set the nearest_square to 36.

limit = 40

# write your while loop here
num = 0 
while (num +1)**2 < limit:
    num += 1
nearest_square = (num)**2


print(nearest_square)
